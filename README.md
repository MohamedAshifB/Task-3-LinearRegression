# 🏠 Linear Regression - Housing Price Prediction

This project is part of the **AI & ML Internship Task 3**, focusing on implementing and understanding **Simple & Multiple Linear Regression** using a housing dataset.

## 📌 Objective
To build a regression model that predicts housing prices based on multiple features such as number of bedrooms, location, and amenities using the Linear Regression algorithm.

---

## 📁 Files Included
- `Linear_Regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code for training and evaluating a Linear Regression model.
- `Housing.csv`: Dataset used for prediction.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

---

## 🛠 Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 🔍 Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**:
   - Loaded the housing dataset.
   - Converted categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
   - Checked for null values and performed necessary cleaning.

2. **Modeling**:
   - Split the dataset into training and test sets.
   - Trained a `LinearRegression` model from `sklearn.linear_model`.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the model using:
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
     - R² Score

4. **Visualization**:
   - Plotted actual vs. predicted prices to visualize model performance.
